This is the repository containing all the codes necessary to reporduce the results for the gene expression analysis and the machine learning study conducted using the sepsis genomics data.
Complicated_course_preprocess.R can be used to do the normalization,probe-gene mapping and other preprocesisng tasks to prepare the data for the gene expression analysis
Complicated_course_DGEs.R can be used to do the Differential gene expression analysis
Machine_learning_models.ipynb can be used to build the ML models and do stability analysis of the data
The heatmap for the top selected genes having p<0.05 and |logFC| > 1 is also attached
